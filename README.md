# azplugins

azplugins is a component for [HOOMD-blue][1] which expands its functionality for
tackling a variety of problems in soft matter physics. Currently, azplugins is
tested against v4.8.2 of HOOMD-blue. See [CHANGELOG.rst](CHANGELOG.rst) for a
list of recent development.

## Compiling azplugins

azplugins follows the [standard component template][2]. It has the same
dependencies used to build HOOMD-blue. With HOOMD-blue installed already, adding
azplugins can be as easy as:

```
git clone https://github.com/mphowardlab/azplugins
cmake -B build/azplugins -S azplugins
cmake --build build/azplugins
cmake --install build/azplugins
```

Please refer to the directions in the HOOMD-blue documentation on building an
external component for more information.

### Testing

After building and installing azplugins, you can run our tests with pytest:

```
python -m pytest --pyargs hoomd.azplugins
```

Contributions are welcomed and appreciated! Fork and create a pull request on

## History
