    "In this part of the tutorials, we will use the azplugins implementation of the [reverse perturbation method](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.59.4894) by M&uuml;ller-Plathe to generate shear flow in a simple multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD) fluid. For details on the general method and setup, refer to the [LJ reverse perturbation tutorial](01_reverse_perturbation_1_LJ.ipynb).\n",

    "We want to set up a simulation at a reduced temperature of $k_\\text{B}T=1.0$ and at a number density of $\\rho_\\text{mpcd}=5$ in a cubic box with $L = 10$. Both positions and velocities are set up randomly in the box. If you have an idea what flow field to expect, you can make equilibration faster by modifying the velocities accordingly. MPCD kinematic viscosities can be calculated from (see this [publication](https://journals.aps.org/pre/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.72.016701)): \n",

    "For the tutorial the system was equilibrated for 10,000 timesteps with  stochastic rotation dynamics (SRD) with an angle $\\alpha$= ``angle=130`` at a timestep of $\\lambda$= ``dt=0.1``. For a real simulation it may be neccessary to equilibrate the system properly/longer before starting the shear flow. More information about the MPCD algorithm and how to couple MPCD fluids to MD particles can be found in the [hoomd-blue doumentation](https://hoomd-blue.readthedocs.io/en/stable/package-mpcd.html).\n",

    "The main difference between the LJ reverse perturbation and the MPCD reverse perturbation is a slight change in the function and its arguments.

    "\n",
    "For MPCD it is impractical to write actual snapshots of the system. Instead, configuration is saved at the end in numpy arrays for restarting purposes, which can be read in for the next simulation instead of random positions/velocities as starting point.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "For MPCD, the speed of sound should be the upper limit for velocites, so it is advisable to not exceed $v_\\text{max}=0.5$ in the desired flow field. \n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the viscosity is known, $v_\\text{max}$ can be computed from the target Reynolds number $Re$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$v_\\text{max} = \\frac{2\\eta_\\text{mpcd}Re}{\\rho_\\text{mpcd}L_z}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also estimate $v_\\text{max}$ from the known viscosity and the reverse_perturbation parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_\\text{max}=\\frac{\\text{target momentum}\\cdot N_\\text{swap}/\\text{period}}{L_x L_y\\lambda\\eta_\\text{mpcd}}\\frac{L_z}{4}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can also be useful to estimate the parameters for the reverse perturbation based on a desired Reynolds number or for setting up the velocity profile close to the expected shape at the beginning of the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyzing the results \n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation can be analyzed the same way than the LJ fluid. Because the mpcd viscosities are known, the pure mpcd fluid can be a useful check for the simulation setup.\n",
