    "# Tutorial 1: Reverse non-equilibrium simulation of a LJ fluid\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use the azplugins implementation of the [reverse non-equilibrium MD method](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.59.4894) by M&uuml;ller-Plathe to generate shear flow in a simple Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid. It is recommend to read this paper before you continue with the tutorial to familarize yourself with the method. The main benefit of this method over other non-equilibrium techniques to generate shear is that it is relatively straightforward to compute the viscosity of the fluid. The basic idea is to exchange momentum between two areas of the simulation box in an unphysical way by swapping momentum of particles. Then, the physical response of the system is recorded, the velocity gradient generated by of the physical momentum flux. Commonly, non-equilibrium simulations are done the other way around: a velocity gradient is generated (by e.g. Lees-Edwards boundary conditions or SLLOD) and the stress/momentum is measured. Often, it is difficult to measure stress in the simulation, but it generally very easy to measure a velocity gradient. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation box setup in azplugins is shown below. Hoomd-blue convention is that the box dimensions go from $-L/2$ to $L/2$ in each dimension, such that the origin is in the center of the simulation box. For the reverse perturbation plugin, the $x$ direction is the flow direction and the $z$ is the gradient direction. The locations of the two layers where the momentum exchanges are performed are at $\\pm L_z/4$. Each layer has a thickness of `width=`$w$. I recommend using cubic boxes or boxes elongated in the gradient direction only. For details please see this [publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04097.pdf) and references therein, as well as the follow up [publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07086.pdf)."

    "A triangular shaped flow is established from swapping momentum between particles in the two exchange regions. Because of periodic boundary conditions, the box contains two linear shear regions between the two exchange regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "To decide which particle pairs momentum to swap, the original publication uses the particles in the exchange region which have the largest momentum in the opposing direction of the flow. For more control over the flow, the plugin follows this [publication](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3276454) and allows you to specify a target momentum with the variable ``target_momentum`` instead of picking the largest opposing pair. This way, the algorithm uses the pair with momentum closest to $\\pm$``target_momentum``, resulting in a more consistent, predictable momentum swap each time. \n",

    "### System setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to set up a simple equlibrated LJ fluid simulation. If you are not familiar with this, check out the [hoomd-blue tutorial](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/glotzerlab/hoomd-examples/blob/master/Tutorial%20-%20MD%20-%20Lennard%20Jones.ipynb). In principle, the reverse perturbation algorithm can be applied to many different systems. We have found it to work best with fairly homogeneous fluid-like systems, strongly ordered or gel-like networks might not work as nicely. It is strongly suggested to do extensive testing for your system of choice if you wish to apply the reverse perturbation method to a new system. Start with a pure solvent, confirming known fluid properties and check the flow profile in all dimensions extensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reverse perturbation method conserves both momentum and kinetic energy and should not need a thermostat. In fact, it does not work well if you apply a global thermostat, because the thermostat will not take the gradient into account when calculating the temperature. If your system needs thermostatting, you may want to either use a local cell based thermostat or thermostat only the non-swapped dimensions. \n",

In a real simulation, you should  record all quantities of interest, including density, temperature and other velocity components in all spatial directions. You can use the ``hoomd.analyze.callback()`` with a custom class to do so. We have observed all kinds of gradients, including unwanted ones when using this method, you are strongly encuraged you to thorougly test this for your system/solvent of choice. \n",

    "The next part is setting up all properties we want to record during the shear flow simulation, we use hoomds ``hoomd.analyze.log`` to record the momentum exchanged during the simulation. The reverse perturbation azplugin registers a variable called ``rp_momentum`` to hoomd. It contains the value of the exchanged momentum for each execution of the timestep before. So, value reported on timestep 0 will always be zero, the value at timestep 1 will be the momentum exchanged on timestep 0, and so on. This is because of the order how things are executed within hoomd. The variable only records the value of the current execution. Meaning, if you want to know the exact amount of momentum exchanged during the simulation, you have to call \n",

    "The plugin has a `group`, enabling you to choose which particles you would like to apply this plugin to. For example if you have solutes in solvent, you can only swap momentum of the solvent particles and leave the solutes untouched. Simply create a \"solvents\" group and assign the plugin to only operate on it and not all particles. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `width` parameter sets the width of the exchange regions. What you should choose here depends on the density and system size. Because the swapping only happens between pairs in the exchange regions, they need to be big enough to contain some particles to pick from. So, the actual thing you care about is the average number of particles in the regions. The velocity profile will be deviating from the linear behavior in the excange regions and will not result in two perfect triangles, in case of the LJ fluid it results in rounded-off tips. \n",
    "So, as a result aim for as small as possible and as big as needed. The easiest way to test it is to do a quick check of the average number of particles in the exchange regions and run various small/short simulations, recording the exchanged momentum for every swap. See if it is constant and doesn't have zero recordings in between, because zero exchanged momentum usually means that there was no pair at all to exchange momentum between, so `width` was too small. The width also limits the maximum achivable shear to a certain degree, again, if no pairs are left to swap, no momentum can be exchanged. \n",

    "The following parameters determine the value of the momentum exchanged and therefore the shear flow which is generated: \n",

    "- The parameter `Nswap` sets how many pairs are supposed to be swapped per execution. It gives the maximum, not the minimum. If the algorithm doesn't find suitable pairs, nothing will be swapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The next parameter, `period` just gives the period of execution of the plugin.  It has been noted in the [literature](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3276454) , that it is better to try to achive a more constant momentum exchange for a more steady state. What this means is, that it might be beneficial to try, for example `Nswap=2, period=1` instead of `Nswap=10, period=5`. While both combinations result in the same number of pairs swapped on average, the first one is more continous.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The last parameter `target_momentum` tunes what the momentum swap per particle should be. This parameter, in conjunction with the other ones, can be used to set the overall momentum exchanged over time. If you choose a very large value, the algorihm is unlikely to find pairs with that momentum and will just swap the two biggest ones. For estimating realistic values I recommend to look at the Boltzmann distribution of the velocities and see what momentum values are present in the system at that temperature. If you record `rp_momentum` you should get values close to $2\\cdot$`target_momentum`, because the particle in the lower exchange region had a momentum close to `+target_momentum` and the particle in the upper echchange region `-target_momentum`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no easy way or standard recipie for picking the parameters. You should do some simple estimates about how much momentum you roughly want (based on the expected viscosity of your system) to be exchanged and vary the parameters extensively to test. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyzing the results\n",
    "\n",
    "First, have a look at the generated trajectory. Use either [vmd](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) with the [gsd plugin](https://github.com/mphoward/gsd-vmd), [ovito](https://www.ovito.org/), or your favorite configuration viewer. You should see a homogeneous fluid. The parameters in this tutorial generate a shear rate which is probably hard to see with the naked eye, but if you increase the shear rate, then you'll be able to see the flow. Check for inhomogeneites, bubbles or other unexpected features. For a fluid which can phase separate, this might indicate unwanted temperature/density gradients.\n",

    "You should see a triangular shaped flow profile, with a maximum of $\\approx 0.07$ in the upper exchange region at $L_z/4=10/4=2.5$ and a minimum of $\\approx -0.07$ in the lower exchange region at $-2.5$. Because the simulation wasn't very long, the histogram isn't very smooth, which can be improved with runtime. Also note that we also recorded the startup of the flow from the quiescent equilibrated liquid. Because the simulation was shorter, this effect is probably noticable. To avoid this for your real simulation start recording after the shear flow is established. Simply run a short shear simulation after equilibration, before recording.  The slope of the linear parts in the velocity profile is the shear rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method of generating shear has a upper limit as well as a lower limit for the shear rate. You will see that the velocity profiles eventually will not be triangular anymore if you increase the shear rate by swapping more and more pairs, swapping more frequently or increasing the target momentum. This indicates that you've reached the upper level of the linear shear response regime of your fluid. For a LJ fluid, the shear profiles become somewhat sine/S-shaped. In that case, the slope is not constant, so the shear rate is also not constant, preventing the calculation of the viscosity. If your shear rate is too low, the slope will be very difficult to measure and essentially resemble noise, making your viscosity measurment very inaccurate. \n",

    "We can also check what momentum we exchange during the simulation:"
